    I faced that issue what I tried to dynamically compile C#
    code with the netstandard version of
    `System.CodeDom <https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.CodeDom/>`_:
    `Cannot compile simple dynamic code after migration on .netstandard 2.0 (CodeDom throws System.PlatformNotSupportedException) <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49655478/cannot-compile-simple-dynamic-code-after-migration-on-netstandard-2-0-codedom>`_.
    I tried som easy solution but it did not seem
    I could make it to work without making too
    many changes. I'll give up for the time being.
