    :title: Playground with C# and Python

    The project offers the possibility to speed up :epkg:`Python`
    with :epkg:`C#`. That's what :epkg:`pythonnet` already does.
    The objective is also to add custom :epkg:`C#` assemblies
    as part of the build and to import them from ::epkg:`Python`.
    The first step of this project was to prepare a 
    continuous build which works on Windows and Linux.
    It was not that so obvious to install :epgk:`dotnet`,
    :epkg:`Python` and :epkg:`pythonnet` on the same
    build for :epkg:`travis` and :epkg:`circleci`.
