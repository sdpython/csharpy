    I was trying to call a C# function directly from Python.
    I finally decided to do it from C++ following this article:
    `Write a custom .NET Core host to control the .NET runtime from your native code
    <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/netcore-hosting>`_.
    I mixed with some of the code implemented in :epkg:`nimbusml`
    to finally use :epkg:`pybind11` to write a module which
    call a C# function. Everything is implemented in `csnative
    <https://github.com/sdpython/csharpy/tree/master/src/csharpy/csnative>`_.
